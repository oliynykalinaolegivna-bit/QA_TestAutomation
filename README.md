🛠️ Tech Stack

⚠️ Important Notes

.gitignore Configuration

Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file in your project root with the following content:

node_modules/
test-results/
playwright-report/
playwright/.cache/


This prevents committing unnecessary files to your repository:
- `node_modules/` - dependencies installed by npm
- `test-results/` - test execution results
- `playwright-report/` - HTML reports generated by Playwright
- `playwright/.cache/` - Playwright browser binaries

Playwright generates `.gitignore` automatically during initialization, but other frameworks may not. 

📖 Learn more about `.gitignore`: [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
